                <h3>Dining Dollars Calculator</h3>
                <p>This is a Python program I developed to track my dining dollars more efficiently while at college. It helps me keep track of my expenses and avoid running out of funds during the semester.</p>

                <h3>First Lego League Class Project</h3>
                <p> This was a project that I did in one of my college classes, where we had to design a robot to complete a set of tasks. For that project, my role was the program
                  developer, as I made up the code (albeit it was just block code like in Scratch) that helped the robot complete the tasks.

                  Here is a sample output (not the one I used for the assignment):

                <h3>Discord Cyber Bot</h3>
                <p>This is a Discord bot that I made that would take in commands to find CTFs and say other things, and produce an output (which can be seen below).</p>
