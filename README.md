# all-about-me-website
Nice, you made it to the readme!

 This website is supposed to be a personal website that others can look at in order to see my accomplishments and find out about who I am as a person and what I like to do. But hey, congrats to you for making it to the README file! Ping me using the email feature or by accessing any of the icons and telling me "Flash is a good dog".

 P.S., If you're interested in HTML I can show some of the source code that I wrote ;)
