# My Portfolio Website

Nice, you made it to the readme!

This website is supposed to be a personal website that others can look at to see my accomplishments and find out about who I am as a person and what I like to do.

You can visit the website here: https://bradypcook.bitbucket.io/index.html 

Cheers!
